# General guidelines

* Use an editor which supports [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)
* Follow [Fortran best practices](https://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html)

## Vim

Vim users could benefit by setting:
```vim
set exrc
set secure
```
which enables syntax highlighting for file extensions used in `lib/Nek5000`.
